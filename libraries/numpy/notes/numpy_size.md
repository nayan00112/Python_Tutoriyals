In **NumPy**, the attribute `arra.size` (without parentheses) is used to determine the **total number of elements** in the array `arra`. It returns an integer representing the size of the array.

On the other hand, if you use `arra.size()` (with parentheses), it would result in an **error** because `size` is not a method that requires invocation with parentheses. Instead, it is an attribute that you can access directly.

Remember, when working with NumPy arrays, use `arra.size` to get the size, and avoid using parentheses. ğŸŒŸ
