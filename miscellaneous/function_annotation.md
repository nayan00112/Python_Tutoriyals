Yes, the `->` arrow notation you see in Python function definitions, such 
as `def __init__(self) -> None:`, is called a "function annotation". 

In this specific case, `-> None` indicates that the function `__init__` 
returns `None`. However, it's important to note that these annotations 
are not strictly enforced by Python itself; they're primarily used for 
documentation purposes and can be accessed via the function's 
`__annotations__` attribute.

Here's what it means:

- `def __init__(self) -> None:`: This declares a method called `__init__` 
for a class. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class 
itself. The `-> None` part indicates that this method returns `None`. 
`None` is a special Python object representing the absence of a value, 
commonly used to signify that a function doesn't return anything 
meaningful.

Function annotations can be used with parameters as well, not just return 
types. For instance:

```python

def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:

    return x + y

```

Here, `x: int` and `y: int` annotate the types of the parameters, and `-> 
int` annotates the return type of the function. Again, Python doesn't 
enforce these annotations, but they can be helpful for documentation and 
type hinting purposes, especially in larger projects or when using 
type-checking tools like MyPy.
